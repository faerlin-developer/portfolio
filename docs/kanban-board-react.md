This single-page web application lets users create tasks, organize them into four lanes (To Do, In Progress, Review, Completed), and move tasks forward or backward between lanes. It uses Vite as a built tool and React state with localStorage persistence, TailwindCSS for styling, and is built from modular components (Task, TaskForm, TaskList, Lane) for reusability. A Dockerfile is provided for easy deployment.

### Key Features

- __Task Management__: Add new tasks via a task form component. A task has the following attributes: _title_, _category_, _priority_, and _description_. Each task card is styled with Tailwind (rounded corners, dynamic styling, centered layout).
- __Kanban Lanes__: There are four workflow stages: _To Do_, _In Progress_, _Review_, and _Completed_. Tasks are displayed in their corresponding lane.
- __Task Movement__: Each task has forward and backward buttons to move between lanes. Movement is restricted (e.g. canâ€™t move backward from _To Do_ or forward from _Completed_).
- __Persistence__: Users create tasks using a form and delete them using a delete button. To make the experience seamless, all task actions, including adding, moving, and deleting, are persisted with the browser's localStorage. This ensures that the board's state is saved across browser sessions. When users refresh the page or return later, their tasks remain exactly where they left them, without requiring a backend database.
